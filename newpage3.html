 			The Why Axis website had a statement of, 'try to avoid clutter and remove as much nonessential information as possible. retain clean minimal aesthetic reading experience as pleasurable as possible’. Graphic design is art that needs to be functional which implicates that simple and easily legible designs would be best. The video about The New Yorker magazine invoked thoughts and impressions of how graphic designers were becoming more conscious of the need to change the artistic perception of their fonts, layouts, and the art within the layouts. One of the fonts used to have a few letters underlined in a word which created a new style. It may seem unnecessary for people who read the magazine for just the pleasure of reading, but people who enjoyed the style of magazines would’ve enjoyed the font. Aside from that, it may have been useful to apply the font to a word with the purpose of emphasizing it as a title or heading. For example, the letter A in the word Art was underlined, which seems unnecessary. It feels like readers would need to add an accent to the word when it is not needed. The current website doesn’t have the font that was described above. Instead, the curvy, simple, and clean-cut fonts allow the readers’ eyes not to be tired, for sharp-edged, sophisticated fonts may be hard to look at for a long time. Important words, such as headlines are bolded as well. It is aesthetically pleasing to look at and looks elegant because of it’s long length. The New Yorker may not have made drastic changes to their layouts, fonts, or logo of their french aristocrat online. However, they have made enough small changes to keep up the urban and modern feeling without losing their style. As said from the director, Wyatt Mitchell, he wanted the playful, whimsy character back into the magazines. Being playful definitely helps the readers engage and enjoy the changes as well. They have also brought in new artists into their studio to be refreshed in artistic senses. It is understandable that The New Yorker wanted to keep most of their reputation, for they have been running the business since 1925.
