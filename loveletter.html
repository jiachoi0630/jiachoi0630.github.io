For my love letter, I'll be introducing Hayao Miyazaki and my three favorite films that were directed by him. I don’t want to spoil the movies so I’ll try to be brief with talking about the films. I encourage everyone to watch his animations!<p>
Hayao Miyazaki is a Japanese film director, animator, producer, and screenwriter. 
<p>

<p>
His first film was 'Nausicaä of the Valley of the Wind' which first came out in 1984, way before we were born. 
It’s a film about a princess called Nausicaa who takes part in saving her village on the valley and making world peace. It’s been a long time since I’ve watched the movie so I don’t remember all the details. Sadly, it’s not my favorite film. The storyline was probably too predictable or boring for me which was why I don’t remember much about it.
<p>

Hayao Miyazaki founded Ghibli Studio in 1985. This is the picture of his logo/introduction screen that comes up every time before his movie starts playing. <p>
The character shown in the Ghibli Studio is the character, Totoro!<p>
The reason why Totoro comes up in the introduction scene is because his second film that came out three years after he founded Ghibli Studio was My Neighbor Totoro, which is technically his first film under the studio's name.

<p>
This is my third favorite movie because Satsuki the tall girl with dark brown hair and Mei the short girl with light brown hair are sisters and the movie reminded me of me and my little sister when we were little. We were silly little kids who cared for each other. Of course, we still do.

<p>
Basically, this movie is about two girls, Satsuki and Mei who moved with their father because their mother was sick and had to move hospitals. They meet a forest spirit called Totoro and have fun moments together. It’s one of the movies where it’s light-hearted.<p>

It's best to watch it with your sibling or family. It's not an action packed animation so it might bore you

Howl’s Moving Castle is my second favorite movie. <p><p>
It was released 9 years ago. This movie was based on the book written by Diana Wynne Jones. I read the book and this was the first film that made me think that a film can be better than a book. Hayao Miyazaki made a totally different version of Howl’s Moving Castle that makes you forget what you’ve imagined in the book. 
<p>

<p>
He knew how to put his own twist. But I still encourage everyone to read the book first before you watch the film. Vaguely it’s about a girl named Sophie who turns into an old grandma by an evil witch and encounters a magician named Howl to break the spell. There are many other characters and they all go through many hardships and do fun things together.
<p>

<p>
That is one of my favorite scenes. Howl’s room filled with toys and random things as if he were a child.

<p>
This is Spirited Away. It’s my first favorite movie. This film won Picture of the Year at the Japanese Academy Awards and was the first anime film to win an American Academy Award.<p>
This was first animation movie I’ve seen that was directed by Hayao Miyazaki. <p>
I was in fourth grade when I first watched it with my little sister on DVD at my dad’s friend’s house. This is my favorite animation movie. I love the music and bizarreness of the film. Some people might just find it plain weird but I love it.

<p>
Basically, this movie is about a girl named Chihiro that had to move unwillingly because of her parents. Before they got to their new home, they end up being stuck in a spirit world. Chihiro needs to save her parents since they’ve become pigs. She meets a boy called Haku and other spirits that causes good and bad situations. I won't be saying anymore since I don't want to ruin the whole plot. <p>

<p>
 Miyazaki's films always have themes like humanity's relationship with nature and technology. The protagonists of his films are often girls that overcome hardships and never give up. So it feels like I could relate to the film to myself since I am a girl with many things to overcome too.

I loved Spirited Away so much that it influenced me to make two art pieces for my art portfolio that got me into MICA. <p>That's all, Thank you.
