		<h4>
	Give a Gift <p>
	</center>
</h4>

This assignment was to give a gift to someone using our graphic design/computer skills. So I decided to make gifs as a gift! It was my first time making gifs, as I learned how to make them by looking at tutorials. The purpose was to make people laugh or smile as soon as they saw the gifs. I was pretty successful. 

<table classs="style2">

<tr>
<td>
		<center><img src="Totoro.gif"/>  <p> This is a Totoro doll that my friend Vo gave from his trip to Japan.  <p> So I decided to use the doll and make a fun gif.  </center>
		
</td> 
	&nbsp;<p> 


<td><center><img src="vo.jpg" /> <p> This was Vo's reaction on Facebook. <p> </center> <p> </td>
</tr>
<p>
<tr>
<td><center><img src="hirshhorn1.gif" /> <p> I went to Hirshorn Museum at Washington D.C. with a friend called Leslie. My parents were worried that I might not make it alive during the trip. So, I sent them a gif showing that I was ok. </center> <p> </td>
<td><center><img src="momdad.jpg" /> <p> This is my mom's reaction typed in Korean on Skype chat. This is the exact translation: "Hahahah This is so fun and pretty. Thank you Jia. You made me smile wide as soon as I woke up this morning." </center> <p> </td>
</tr>
<p>
<tr>
	 <td> <center> <img src="WHEEEE.gif" /> <p> These were a series of pictures that my friend Angel took last winter, of my friend Zoe and me going down the steps of our dorms, on our way to dinner. I felt nostalgic while looking through the picture albums on Facebook. Due to our busy Fall semester and living in different homes this year, we couldn't hang out as much as we did before. This gif brought fun memories back. Obviously, I gave this gif to Zoe. <p> </center> <p> </td> 
	<td> <center><img src="zoe.jpg" /> <p> This is Zoe's reaction on Facebook. <p> </center> <p> </td> 
</tr>
<p>
<tr>
	<td><center><img src="MI-CHI-GO.gif" /> <p> As I went to the Hirshorn Museum with my friend Leslie, as I have mentioned before, I decided to make this gif for her. She helped me take photographs of art pieces that I was interested in. As a small thank you gift, I made a gif that goes along with the beat to a K-Pop song called 'Mi-Chi-Go' by G-Dragon. (Michigo is Korean and means crazy in English.)<p> </center> <p></td>

	<td><center><img src="leslie.jpg" /> <p> This is Leslie's reaction on Facebook. <p> </center> <p></td>
</tr>
<p>
<tr>
	<td> <center><img src="Evil-food.gif" /> <p> This was a perfect small gift for my little sister, Annais. I love teasing her from across the seas. She's in South Korea, studying her high school away so that she could attend college in America, like me. I miss her so much. <p> </center> <p> </td>

	<td> <center><img src="sister1.JPG" /> <img src="sister2.JPG" /> <img src="sister3.JPG" /> <p> These three images are my sister's reactions on Kakao Talk chat. <p> (Kakao Talk is a Korean Smartphone App that allows people who have an account chat for free.) <p> Translation for Korean part: "What? Why? hahahah Hey lol You die!!! That looks delicious." <p> </center> </td>
