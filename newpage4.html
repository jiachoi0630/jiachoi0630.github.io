<h2>
&nbsp;<p>

	Work
<p>

In one to three sentences, what do you do?
Make a design for a K-pop girl group called 'Tom Boy' that will be accepted/loved by Americans and throughout the world. 

<p>

What's your favorite thing about it?
K-pop groups choose a certain theme but its random all the time. Aesthetics and being unique are important. 

<p>

Can you describe your industry to me? What is it and how does it work?
My industry will make sure that the singers/dancers in the group are talented in singing/dancing. Our industry doesn't allow idols to become singers/dancers if they don't have the skills to be one. 

&nbsp;<p>

Mission and Vision

<p>

Why did you start your company?
I started to have a certain respect towards K-pop since I came to America. I used to dislike K-pop and thought the industry wasn't quite there yet. But I failed to look at the potential of how it could change Korea and Asia's culture. So I wanted to start a K-pop group myself. 

<p>

Why are you building this product? Or, what led you to the idea?
Watching the show 'WIN' produced by YG Entertainment had led me to this idea. 

<p>

What are your goals for the next three to six months?
My goal is to improve my skills in web designing and branding. Especially knowing which typography, shapes, and color palettes work best with each other. 

<p>

Describe where you want to take people. What does the world look like if you're successful?
I want people to have fun even in tough times. If I'm successful I would help those that are working hard to become successful like I am and be free from regulations.
